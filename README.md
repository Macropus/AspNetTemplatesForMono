Asp.Net MVC 4 Templates For Mono
================================

Asp.Net MVC4 projects for .Net 4.0 and .Net 4.5, which build and run on Mono.

The 2 basic templates, Mvc4CSharpRazorFx40Intranet and Mvc4CSharpRazorFx45Intranet, should run out-of-the-box.
Although they are NuGet-enabled, all the required dlls are in the repo. They are most recently tested 
in Xamarin Studio on Mac OS X running Mono 3.2.5, but the .Net 4.0 template ran on Mono 2.8.

They were created from the Visual Studio MVC4 Intranet templates, VS2010 for the 4.0 template, & VS2012 for the 4.5 template.
